# Phishing Email Analysis

## Overview  
In this project, I analyzed a phishing email to identify its key malicious characteristics and educate users on how to recognize such threats.

## Objective  
- Understand how phishing attacks are structured  
- Identify spoofed sender details and malicious URLs  
- Document social engineering tactics used  
- Provide actionable advice for end-users

## Methodology  
1. Collected a sample phishing email from a publicly available simulator.  
2. Examined email headers to check sender authenticity.  
3. Analyzed embedded links and attachments for suspicious behavior.  
4. Identified social engineering elements designed to trick the user.  

## Key Findings  
- The senderâ€™s email address was spoofed to appear legitimate.  
- Links redirected to domains unrelated to the claimed sender, using URL shorteners to mask real destinations.  
- Urgent language and scare tactics were employed to create panic and prompt immediate action.  
- The email lacked personalized greetings, a common red flag.  

## Lessons Learned  
- Always verify sender email addresses carefully.  
- Hover over links before clicking to inspect URLs.  
- Be cautious of urgent or threatening language in emails.  
- Use email security tools that flag suspicious emails.
